# API rate limiting

Codestead uses `rate-limiter-flexible` with PostgreSQL-backed fixed-window counters so enforcement remains consistent across app processes and after a process restart. It does not require Redis. Every identity component of a counter key is an HMAC-SHA-256 digest over a domain separator, policy scope, identity type, and normalized identity. Raw IP addresses, email addresses, invitation tokens, and user IDs are never written to the rate-limit table.

## Default budgets

| Policy | Default budget | Identity | Protected operation |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `access_request_ip` | 5 / 15 minutes | trusted client IP | Request invite access |
| `access_request_email` | 3 / day | normalized email | Request invite access |
| `invitation_validate_ip` | 30 / 15 minutes | trusted client IP | Validate invitation |
| `invitation_validate_token` | 10 / 15 minutes | invitation token | Validate invitation |
| `invitation_activate_ip` | 10 / hour | trusted client IP | Activate account |
| `invitation_activate_token` | 5 / hour | invitation token | Activate account |
| `fresh_mfa_user` | 10 / 15 minutes | authenticated user | Fresh TOTP assertion |
| `session_revocation_user` | 3 / day | authenticated user | Request device revocation |
| `credential_write_user` | 10 / hour | authenticated user | Add and validate provider key |
| `onboarding_complete_user` | 10 / hour | authenticated user | Complete onboarding |
| `ai_tutor_minute` | 20 / minute | authenticated user | Codestead mentor request |
| `ai_tutor_day` | 500 / day | authenticated user | Codestead mentor request |
| `code_run_minute` | 10 / minute | authenticated user | Playground compile/run |
| `code_run_hour` | 120 / hour | authenticated user | Playground compile/run |
| `exam_start_user` | 5 / hour | authenticated user | Start formal exam |
| `exam_run_user` | 20 / minute | authenticated user | Compile/run during exam |
| `exam_submit_user` | 10 / minute | authenticated user | Submit formal exam |
| `file_upload_user` | 10 / hour | authenticated user | Upload learner file |
| `github_review_user` | 5 / hour | authenticated user | Review public GitHub project |
| `learning_request_user` | 5 / day | authenticated user | Request subject/topic content |

These request budgets complement provider token grants, upload byte quotas, runner concurrency, exam idempotency, and Better Auth's own login protections; they do not replace those controls.

## Enforcement behavior

- The library performs one atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` consume operation. Runtime table creation, in-memory blocking, insurance/fallback limiters and unbounded library cleanup are disabled. Concurrent requests cannot exceed a budget through a read/update race.
- Public decisions still saturate at `limit + 1`. The library stores consumed points up to the legacy database cap of 1,000,001. That exact cap CHECK rejection remains a 429; all other persistence errors fail closed with 503.
- Expired rows are deleted opportunistically at most once per five minutes per app process, in batches of 500. Cleanup failure does not invalidate an already successful enforcement decision.
- All current protected operations fail closed. If PostgreSQL or required key configuration is unavailable, the request returns `503 RATE_LIMIT_UNAVAILABLE` and `Retry-After: 30`; expensive/provider/runner work is not started.
- An exhausted budget returns `429 RATE_LIMITED`. Responses include `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset`, `RateLimit-Policy`, `Retry-After`, and compatibility `X-RateLimit-*` fields. Successful responses include the applicable budget headers.
- Multi-window checks are deliberately conservative. If a daily/hourly check blocks after a minute check was consumed, the minute count is not rolled back. This prevents retry amplification.

## Secrets and proxy trust

Set `RATE_LIMIT_HASH_KEY` to an independent random value of at least 32 bytes when practical. If it is empty, the application uses `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` with explicit domain separation. Neither value belongs in the database, logs, support output, or backups that omit live host secrets.

`RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_IP_HEADER` defaults to `cf-connecting-ip`. Only Cloudflare Tunnel may reach the app origin. If direct origin traffic is possible, a caller can forge proxy headers and split its IP budget. Missing or invalid trusted headers enter one shared `unavailable` bucket, which is intentionally restrictive. Never configure a comma-separated forwarding chain; the helper accepts exactly one syntactically valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

## Overrides

`RATE_LIMIT_OVERRIDES_JSON` may override only known policy names. Limits must be integers from 1 through 1,000,000; windows must be integers from 1 through 31,536,000 seconds; failure mode must be `closed` or `open`. Invalid JSON, unknown names, or unsafe values fail protected requests rather than silently disabling enforcement.

Example:

```env
RATE_LIMIT_OVERRIDES_JSON={"ai_tutor_minute":{"limit":12,"windowSeconds":60},"github_review_user":{"limit":3,"windowSeconds":3600}}
```

Restart app processes after changing policy configuration. Lowering a limit applies immediately to the current fixed window. Do not set high-cost or anonymous policies to `open` without a documented security decision.

## Operations

Monitor rates of HTTP 429 and `RATE_LIMIT_UNAVAILABLE` responses without logging request identities. A sudden cohort-wide 429 for anonymous endpoints can indicate a missing trusted IP header, because all such requests share the `unavailable` bucket. Check the Cloudflare-to-origin header and origin firewall before raising the limit.

The `api_rate_limit` table contains only `key`, `points` and `expire`. Its key encodes the unchanged scope, HMAC identity digest and epoch window start; expiry retains one extra window. It can be included in normal database backup, but it is disposable operational state and does not need restoration. After a restore without counters, budgets simply begin fresh. Do not join hashes to learner data or attempt to reverse identities.

Run the focused safety suite after changing policies or wrappers:

```bash
npm test -- src/lib/security/__tests__/rate-limit.test.ts src/lib/security/__tests__/rate-limit-boundaries.test.ts
```

The suite covers exact boundaries, concurrent calls, window reset, identity/scope isolation, raw-identifier exclusion, fail-open/closed semantics, atomic SQL shape, cleanup failure, header behavior, proxy parsing, override validation, and route wiring.

## Migration 0071

Stop all app processes before applying `0071_rate_limiter_flexible`, then restart on this release. The migration locks the old table, copies every existing count and expiry without granting a fresh budget, and drops `api_rate_limit_window`. The old binary cannot run against the new layout; rollback requires restoring the pre-migration database and deploying the old binary together. Existing role reconciliation and restore authority pins advance to 0071 without widening grants.

## Atomic auth admission

The Better Auth request plugin enforces sign-in 8/minute, sign-up 3/10 minutes and TOTP verification 6/minute through the existing atomic PostgreSQL limiter before body validation. Endpoint-specific scopes and HMACs of `cf-connecting-ip` use the existing `api_rate_limit` table and fixed epoch windows. Missing/invalid addresses share a restrictive bucket; forwarding headers and API policy/header overrides cannot change auth admission. Denials preserve Better Auth's exact 429 JSON and `X-Retry-After` header; persistence failures return 503 without a memory fallback.

Production always requires atomic database admission, including when `DATABASE_URL` is missing or blank. Configured development/integration processes do too; database-free dev/e2e retains native memory budgets. The native limiter is memory-only as a secondary guard for other default/plugin rules. No additional migration, table, grants or retention policy is required. Counters use the existing API cleanup and survive new auth instances and process restarts.
