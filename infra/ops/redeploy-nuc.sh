usage: redeploy-nuc.sh [--scan|--no-scan] [--dry-run] <git-sha>

Redeploys the pilot NUC deployment to <git-sha>: fetches and checks out the
commit, builds the seven reviewed application images from a clean clone,
swaps only the seven APP_*_IMAGE lines in the running compose.env, runs
migrations only if the migration set changed since the last commit this
script actually deployed, restarts the app+worker services with --no-build
--pull never, and waits for /health/ready.
The resolved commit SHA is exported as SENTRY_RELEASE for Compose; it is
never written into compose.env.

  --scan        Run the Trivy vulnerability gate (default). Trivy runs as a
                pinned container (the NUC has no host packages) with the
                Docker socket and Trivy's cache mounted in.
  --no-scan     Skip Trivy for a quick beta deploy.
  --dry-run     Print every command instead of running it. No mutation.

Environment overrides (all optional, defaults match the NUC pilot):
  REPO_ROOT            Root checkout to redeploy in place (default /opt/learncoding)
  BUILD_ROOT            Disposable clean clone used for the image build
                        (default /var/tmp/codestead-build)
  COMPOSE_ENV_FILE      Running compose env file (default /etc/learncoding/compose.env)
  COMPOSE_PROJECT       Compose -p project name (default learncoding)
  COMPOSE_FILE          Primary compose file (default $REPO_ROOT/compose.yaml)
  COMPOSE_OVERRIDE_FILE Optional override compose file
                        (default $REPO_ROOT/compose.override.yml, used only if present)
  TRIVY_CACHE_DIR       Trivy cache dir (default /var/lib/learncoding/trivy-cache)
  TRIVY_IMAGE           Pinned aquasec/trivy image reference (default matches
                        the Trivy 0.69.3 the app-images scan pipeline requires)
  DEPLOY_STATE_FILE     Where this script records the last commit it actually
                        deployed (default /var/lib/learncoding/redeploy-nuc/deployed-revision)
  HEALTH_WAIT_SECONDS   Seconds to wait for /health/ready (default 180)

This script must run as root on the NUC. It never deletes volumes or data,
and never touches any Compose project other than $COMPOSE_PROJECT.
